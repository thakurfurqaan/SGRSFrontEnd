                                that have been confirmed and share these data with CDC. Since it takes time to conduct

                                Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses that are common in people and may different
                                species of animals, including camels, cattle, cats, and bats. &nbsp;Rarely, animal
                                coronaviruses can infect people and then spread between people. This occurred with <a
                                        href="/coronavirus/mers/index.html">MERS-CoV</a> and <a href="/sars/index.html">SARS-CoV</a>,
                                and now with the virus that causes COVID-19. The SARS-CoV-2 virus is a betacoronavirus,
                                like MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV. All three of these viruses have their origins in bats. The
                                sequences from U.S. patients are similar to the one that China initially posted,
                                suggesting a likely single, recent emergence of this virus from an animal reservoir.
                                However, the exact source of this virus is unknown.</p>

                                evidence of widespread COVID-19 illness in communities across the country, CDC

                                    face covering</a>&nbsp;to cover their nose and mouth in the community setting. This
                                is an additional public health measure people should take to reduce the spread of
                                COVID-19 in addition to (not instead of) social distancing, frequent hand cleaning and
                                other everyday preventive actions. A cloth face covering is not intended to protect the
                                wearer, but may prevent the spread of virus from the wearer to others. This would be
                                especially important in the event that someone is infected but does not have symptoms. A
                                cloth face covering should be worn whenever people must go into public settings (grocery
                                stores, for example). Medical masks and N-95 respirators are reserved for healthcare
                                workers and other first responders, as recommended by current CDC guidance.</p></div>

                                spreads. Coronaviruses are thought to be spread most often by respiratory droplets.
                                Although the virus can survive for a short period on some surfaces, it is unlikely to be
                                spread from domestic or international mail, products or packaging. However, it may be
                                possible that people can get COVID-19 by touching a surface or object that has the virus
                                on it and then touching their own mouth, nose, or possibly their eyes, but this is not
                                thought to be the main way the virus spreads.</p>

                                coverings should NOT be put on babies or children younger than 2 because of the danger
                                of suffocation. Children younger than 2 years of age are listed as an exception as well
                                as anyone who has trouble breathing or is unconscious, incapacitated, or otherwise

                                <p>Wearing cloth face coverings is a public health measure people should take to reduce
                                    the spread of COVID-19 in addition to (not instead of) social distancing, frequent
                                    hand cleaning ,and other everyday preventive actions. A cloth face covering is not
                                    intended to protect the wearer but may prevent the spread of virus from the wearer
                                    to others. This would be especially important if someone is infected but does not
                                    have symptoms. Medical face masks and N95 respirators are still reserved for

                                far, there does not seem to be a lot of illness in children. Most illness, including
                                serious illness, is happening in adults of working age and older adults. However,
                                children do get the virus and become ill. Many schools across the country have announced
                                dismissals for temporary periods. Keep track of school dismissals in your community.
                                Read or watch local media sources that report school dismissals. If schools are
                                dismissed temporarily, use alternative childcare arrangements, if needed.</p>
                                <p>If your child/children become sick with COVID-19, notify their childcare facility or
                                    school. Talk with teachers about classroom assignments and activities they can do
                                    from home to keep up with their schoolwork.</p>
                                <p>Discourage children and teens from gathering in other public places while school is
                                    dismissed to help slow the spread of COVID-19 in the community.</p></div>

                                    to be treated at the hospital still happens. Some data on children reported that the
                                    majority who needed hospitalization for COVID-19 had at least one underlying medical
                                    condition. The most common underlying conditions reported among children with
                                    COVID-19 include chronic lung disease (including asthma), heart disease, and
                                    conditions that weaken the immune system. This information suggests that children
                                    with these underlying medical conditions may be at risk for more severe illness from
                                    COVID-19.</p>

                                when someone has been infected, so a positive result from this test indicates that

                                    to the virus will protect someone. Scientists are conducting research to answer
                                    those questions.</p>
                                <p>Antibody tests may not be able to tell you if you are currently infected because it
                                    typically takes 1 to 3 weeks to develop antibodies to SARS-CoV-2. To tell if you are
                                    currently infected, you would need a test that identifies the virus in samples from
                                    your upper respiratory system, such as a nasopharyngeal swab.</p></div>

                            <div class="card-body"><p>COVID-19 is a new disease and&nbsp;<strong>we are still learning
                                how it spreads.</strong>&nbsp;The virus that causes COVID-19 is thought to mainly spread
                                from close contact (i.e., within about 6 feet) with a person who is currently sick with
                                COVID-19. The virus likely spreads primarily through respiratory droplets produced when
                                an infected person coughs or sneezes, similar to how influenza and other respiratory
                                infections spread. These droplets can land in the mouths or noses of people who are
                                nearby or possibly be inhaled into the lungs.&nbsp;This type of spread is not a concern
                                after death.</p>
                                <p>It may be possible that a person can get COVID-19 by touching a surface or object
                                    that has the virus on it and then touching their own mouth, nose, or possibly their
                                    eyes, but this is not thought to be the main way the virus spreads.</p>
                                <p>People should consider not touching the body of someone who has died of COVID-19.
                                    Older people and people of all ages with severe underlying health conditions are at
                                    higher risk of developing serious COVID-19 illness. There may be less of a chance of
                                    the virus spreading from certain types of touching, such as holding the hand or
                                    hugging after the body has been prepared for viewing. Other activities, such as
                                    kissing, washing, and shrouding should be avoided before, during, and after the body
                                    has been prepared, if possible. If washing the body or shrouding are important
                                    religious or cultural practices, families are encouraged to work with their
                                    community’s cultural and religious leaders and funeral home staff on how to reduce
                                    their exposure as much as possible. At a minimum, people conducting these activities
                                    should wear disposable gloves. If splashing of fluids is expected, additional
                                    personal protective equipment (PPE) may be required (such as disposable gown,
                                    faceshield or goggles and N-95 respirator).</p>
                                <p>Cleaning should be conducted in accordance with manufacturer’s instructions for all
                                    cleaning and disinfection products (e.g., concentration, application method and

                                <ul>
                                    <li>Consider removing smaller rugs or carpets from the area completely, so there is
                                        less that needs to be vacuumed.
                                    </li>
                                    <li>Use a vacuum equipped with a high-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filter, if
                                        available.
                                    </li>
                                    <li>Do not vacuum a room or space that has people in it. Wait until the room or
                                        space is empty to vacuum, such as at night, for common spaces, or during the day
                                        for private rooms.
                                    </li>
                                    <li>Consider temporarily turning off room fans and the central HVAC system that
                                        services the room or space, so that particles that escape from vacuuming will
                                        not circulate throughout the facility.

                                businesses and communities normally use to maintain a healthy environment. Surfaces
                                frequently touched by multiple people, such as door handles, bathroom surfaces, and
                                handrails, should be cleaned with soap and water or another detergent at least daily
                                when facilities are in use. More frequent cleaning and disinfection may be required
                                based on level of use. For example, certain surfaces and objects in public spaces, such
                                as shopping carts and point of sale keypads, should be cleaned and disinfected before
                                each use. Cleaning <em>removes </em>dirt and impurities, including germs, from surfaces.
                                Cleaning alone does not kill germs, but it reduces the number of germs on a surface.</p>

                                cats, reported to be infected with the virus that causes COVID-19, mostly after close
                                contact with people with COVID-19. A tiger at a zoo in New York has also tested positive

                                    ferrets. These findings were based on a small number of animals, and do not show

                                appears it can spread from humans to animals in some situations. CDC is aware of a small
                                number of pets, including cats, reported to be infected with the virus that causes
                                COVID-19, mostly after close contact with people with COVID-19. Most of these animals
                                had contact with a person with COVID-19. A tiger at a New York zoo has also tested
                                positive for the virus that causes COVID-19.</p>
                                <p>At this time, there is no evidence that animals play a significant role in spreading
                                    the virus that causes COVID-19. Based on the limited data available, the risk of
                                    animals spreading COVID-19 to people is considered to be low. The virus that causes
                                    COVID-19 spreads mainly from person to person, typically through respiratory
                                    droplets from coughing, sneezing, or talking.</p>
                                <p>People sick with COVID-19 should isolate themselves from other people and animals,
                                    including pets, during their illness until we know more about how this virus affects
                                    animals. If you must care for your pet or be around animals while you are sick, wear
                                    a cloth face covering and wash your hands before and after you interact with
                                    pets.</p></div>

                                companion animals, including pets and service animals, can spread the virus that causes
                                COVID-19. As with any animal introduced to a new environment, animals recently imported
                                should be observed daily for signs of illness. If an animal becomes ill, the animal
                                should be examined by a veterinarian. Call your local veterinary clinic&nbsp;<strong>before</strong>&nbsp;bringing
                                the animal into the clinic and let them know that the animal was recently imported from

                                COVID-19 is circulating in free-living wildlife in the United States, or that wildlife
                                might be a source of infection for people in the United States. The first case of a wild
                                animal testing positive for the virus in the United States was a tiger with a
                                respiratory illness at a zoo in New York City. However, this tiger was in a captive zoo
                                environment ,and public health officials believe the tiger became sick after being
                                exposed to a zoo employee who was infected and spreading the virus.</p>
                                <p>If a wild animal were to become infected with the virus, we don’t know whether the
                                    infection could then spread among wildlife or if it could spread to other animals,
                                    including pets. Further studies are needed to understand if and how different
                                    animals, including wildlife, could be affected by COVID-19. Because wildlife can
                                    carry other diseases, even without looking sick, it is always important to enjoy
                                    wildlife from a distance.</p>
                                <p>Take steps to prevent getting sick from wildlife in the United States:</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Keep your family, including pets, a safe distance away from wildlife.</li>
                                    <li>Do not feed wildlife or touch wildlife droppings.</li>
                                    <li>Always wash your hands and supervise children washing their hands after working
                                        or playing outside.
                                    </li>
                                    <li>Leave orphaned animals alone. Often, the parents are close by and will return
                                        for their young.
                                    </li>
                                    <li>Consult your state wildlife agency’s guidance if you are preparing or consuming
                                        legally harvested game meat.
                                    </li>
                                    <li>Do not approach or touch a sick or dead animal – contact your state wildlife
                                        agency instead.
                                    </li>

                                of natural ecosystems, and their populations are already declining in the United States.
                                Bat populations could be further threatened by the disease itself or by harm inflicted

                                We are a group of enthusiasts comprising of students and
                                working professionals from
                                IIT Bombay and
                                beyond coming from the fields ranging from engineering, management, biosciences to
                                Humanities and
                                Social Sciences who are passionate towards the issues of social justice. We have come
                                together to
                                make the navigation of the relief process easy in the times of Covid19 crisis. There is
                                a barrage of
                                information circulating around regarding the relief programmes; on the one hand, it is a
                                kind and
                                responsible gesture, however, on the other, at times, the people who actually need
                                relief are not
                                able to navigate the enormous amount of information available and reach the suitable
                                relief
                                providers in their vicinity. So, we decided to create a common platform to bring
                                together the people
                                who need relief, people (Govt. initiatives/NGOs/groups/individuals) who are already
                                providing the
                                relief and the ones who want to volunteer in such relief programmes.

                                urgent help. These are the times when we need cooperation and help more than anything

                                the humanitarian crisis originated through COVID-19. People can register as volunteers
                                or someone
                                who needs help (for food, medicine, accommodation etc.) and NGOs/groups/individuals can
